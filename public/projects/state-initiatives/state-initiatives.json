Through a fantastic collaborative relationship, modules aligned to the 9 indicators and 54 sub-indicators [of the Transition Discoveries Framework] have been created to expand knowledge of transition best practices.  Trainers will also be able to access toolkits with evidence based practices to help teams action plan for transition program improvements!”"

On the way to graduation, many students face barriers that to them seem just too big to get over! Getting a working knowledge and clearer picture of the future helps students to see a path that matters to them. Transition Discoveries is one very effective way to build that vision for both students and school communities. Our partnership with the Transition Discoveries team is helping to shape the way we think about secondary transition as a youth-led, youth-driven experience involving partners at all levels of collaboration.”"
