There are so many options out there and you might still be figuring out if college is right for you. There are a bunch of colleges out there where you can go to a pre-college program there for a few weeks, usually during the summer, and live on campus while taking a class or a few and learn from a mentor on how to be independent and to succeed in college. Here’s the cool part, a pre-college program helps you to prepare for college and earn college credits even before you apply there!",

It was free for me to attend, because a grant paid for it. What they did was they matched me up with a grad student and we went down there, I think it was five Saturdays. And they were down there the whole day, it was like 10-4. And they did different things on campus to look at what different jobs are available. They went in to the city down to Reading Terminal, we learned how to use transportation. I had to do this with the Penn student not with my mom or dad. And I wondered, ‘Oh my gosh, how nice would that be if this grant, if there’s more of them, that more local schools like more local colleges who might have these programs.",
