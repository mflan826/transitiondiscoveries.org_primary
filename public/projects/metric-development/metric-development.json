As a valued member of the Berks County Transition Coordinating Council, I have had the opportunity to work collaboratively with this diverse group in sharing the survey across our county which included self-advocates, caregivers/family members and professionals. The data captured and collected was powerful. It provided important insight to us as a council. We were able to identify areas of success and areas we could improve upon. Together, we had honest and difficult conversations. We brainstormed and began to devise a plan to continue sustainable change for our individuals, families, schools and community. It has truly been an honor to be a part of a project that has an impact right here at home!”"
