The result is often multiple systems that do not properly overlap to provide holistic opportunities and support for young people with disabilities to reach their goals for work, school and living independently now and throughout their lives.<br><br> Through our work we have developed a comprehensive collection of practical, youth and family friendly research-based tools for communities to use in building local knowledge about local transition-related supports, identifying local effective practices and programs and designing new opportunities for all young people with disabilities in the community:</p> <ul> <li> A framework of effective transition according to young people with disabilities, their families and transition stakeholders </li> <li> A community-based action planning approach to improve transition practices </li> <li> Transition lesson plans for stakeholders </li> <li> Written content, videos and tipsheets about transition for young people </li> <li> A continuously growing database of effective transition practices in communities that align with the Transition Discoveries Framework </li></ul>"

        "text": "<p> How do we know what “good transition” looks like when we see it?  That was our guiding question when originally funded by the PA Developmental Disabilities Council (PADDC).  Through a partnership with Temple University, Institute on Disabilities, George Washington University, and the PA Youth Leadership Network we engaged young people with disabilities, their families and stakeholders in a participatory action research project.  This resulted in the the Transition Discoveries Framework and Transition Discoveries Quality Indicator Metric, all based upon the dreams and goals of young people and their families, along with transition stakeholders' view of “what’s working”. <br> <br>Over the past several years, additional PADDC funding supported the Transition Quality Empowerment Project to work with multiple communities (schools, young adults with disabilities, families, and transition stakeholders) to use the Framework and Metric to develop and implement community-based action plans to showcase exemplar practices and design new, innovative programs and opportunities. With the resources and data collected from these projects, the Transition Discoveries website and app were created. Together, they represent a one-stop shop to empower young people with disabilities, families and stakeholders to build their transition knowledge so that they can co-design community-based networks of support for all young people and families.</p> "
