So, your transition team should make sure that you have all the opportunities that you want and need to connect with other people, like friends, professionals who can support you and mentors who can guide you. Relationships are totally the key to succeeding in school, living independently in the community and striving in the workplace!<br /> <br /> Your transition team should help you figure out the best ways for you to communicate (speaking, writing, ASL, email, texting, phone calls, etc.). They can also help you learn the specific social skills that you’ll need for being successful at work, with friends and in school. Practicing negotiation skills and getting honest feedback on how you use them is huge and your transition team can do this for you, too!<br /><br /><ul class='checkli'> <li>Which ways do you communicate best? Which do you want to get even better at using?</li><li>What tips and strategies do you know for working through conflicts with other people?</li><li>What are some things that make up a healthy relationship with friends or co-workers?</li> <li>What kind of boundaries do we have to set with friends, co-workers and people in the community?</li></ul>"
