If you’re a professional, you might use the guide as part of conversations with young people and families before and during transition planning meetings. You can also use the guide to develop your own lessons and activities for young people to build their transition skills (we have done a lot of this for you! Check out our <a href='resources'>“resources”</a> page. Young people and families can use the guide to get in-the-know' before and during transition planning meetings so that they can take charge of the decision making process and ask questions about all the possible supports that exist!

The guide was developed through a rigorous, multi-year, statewide research study in which over 500 young people, families and stakeholders across different cultural groups and socioeconomic regions participated in semi-structured and structured qualitative data collection experiences. The guide’s content is well-aligned to current evidence-based predictors of post-school outcomes for young people with disabilities.
